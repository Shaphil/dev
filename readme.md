# dev - Developer Essentials Installer

`dev` is a CLI tool designed to make it easy to set up a developer's machine with the tools necessary to build their
next big project.

## What's included

Currently, `dev` comes with setup for the following dev tools for the Linux environment,

### Category - Compilers/Interpreters/Runtimes

* Dotnet Core
* Golang
* Oracle JDK
* JavaFX
* NodeJS
* Yarn
* Pip
* Virtualenv
* Rust

### Category - DevOps

* Docker

**Note -** All the tools mentioned are for the Linux (x86/x64) platform, more specifically, Manjaro Linux. The installer
was developed on Manjaro, so some installation uses Manjaro specific installation (for instance, installation with
`pacman` package manager). This in theory should also allow the installer to run seamlessly in any Arch based distro as
well, though the installer was not tested on other distros. So, if you use Arch or any other Arch based distro, you are
welcome to test it. Please report any [issues](https://github.com/Shaphil/dev/issues) that you encounter. Support for
other flavors of Linux coming soon.

Any ideas are welcome. That's what the [discussions](https://github.com/Shaphil/dev/discussions) are for.
